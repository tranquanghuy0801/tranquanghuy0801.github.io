I am currently a 2nd year software engineering student at QUT (Australia). I have a major in Computer Engineering with minors in Robotics & Machine Learning. I am interested in working on developing vision automation systems including self-driving car, human-robot interaction, sports imitation and 3d machoine learning reconstruction

### Education 

* 2014-2017: High School For Gifted Students (HSGS) - Ha Noi - Viet Nam 
* 2017-2021: Queensland University of Technology - Brisbane - Queensland - Australia 

- Coursework: Introduction to Statistical Modelling, Database Management, Introduction to Robotics, Microprocessors & Digital Systems, Programming Principles, Signal Analysis, Software Development, Machine Learning

### Work Experience 

* Vacation Research Student (Project: Social Verbal And Non-Verbal Human-Robot Interaction - **[Github Link](https://github.com/tranquanghuy0801/hand3d)**): Under the supervision of Dr.Nicole Robinson (Faculty of Electrical Engineering & Computer Science) in a project of improving human robot interaction for Pepper robot. My task involves researching the most suitable vision methods and modifying the algorithms scripts for training data and showing the label output precisely. The project application is then deployed on GPU server for faster computation and testing the data more conveniently 

### Personal Projects
