![Thumps Up Detection Challenge](images/hand-gesture.png)

Participating in the Vacation Summer Research Student (VRES) Program at my university, I am doing the project Social Robot Interactivity Using Verbal/Non-Verbal Methods. In the context, I was assigned by my VRES mentor to develop a model to detect the thumbs up/thumbs down hand gesture to advance the tablet application on Pepper robot. Personally, my overall approach is using two models for achieving this task.
